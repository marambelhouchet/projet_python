Plant Disease Information Database

Apple___Apple_scab

Disease: Apple Scab (Venturia inaequalis)

Symptoms:

Circular, olive-green spots appearing on leaves, fruit, and sometimes twigs.

Spots enlarge, become brownish-black, and may merge.

Infected leaves may become distorted, yellow, and drop prematurely.

Fruit spots become corky, dark, and may crack, allowing secondary infections.

Young fruit may become deformed.

What the Farmer Should Do (Treatment):

Sanitation: Rake and destroy fallen leaves and fruit in the autumn to reduce overwintering fungus. Prune trees to improve air circulation.

Fungicides: Apply fungicides starting from bud break and continuing through the growing season according to label instructions and local recommendations. Effective fungicides include captan, sulfur, myclobutanil, and others. Timing is critical, especially around wet periods.

Resistant Varieties: When planting new trees, choose varieties known to be resistant or tolerant to apple scab.

Prevention:

Plant scab-resistant apple varieties.

Maintain good air circulation through proper pruning.

Clean up fallen leaves and fruit each fall.

Use preventative fungicide sprays during susceptible periods (spring, wet weather).

Water at the base of the tree rather than overhead if possible.

Apple___Black_rot

Disease: Apple Black Rot (Botryosphaeria obtusa)

Symptoms:

Leaf Spot ("Frogeye Leaf Spot"): Small purple spots enlarge to circles with tan centers and dark borders, resembling a frog's eye.

Fruit Rot: Starts as a small brown spot, often near the blossom end, enlarging to cover the fruit. Rotting area becomes firm, dark brown to black. Small black fungal structures (pycnidia) may appear in concentric rings on the rotted surface. Infected fruit may shrivel into black "mummies".

Cankers: Reddish-brown, sunken areas on branches or trunk. Cankers can girdle and kill limbs.

What the Farmer Should Do (Treatment):

Sanitation: Prune out dead or cankered branches during dormancy, cutting back to healthy wood. Remove and destroy infected fruit (including mummies) from the tree and the ground.

Fungicides: Apply fungicides effective against black rot during the growing season, particularly from bloom through harvest, as part of a broader disease management program. Captan and sulfur-containing fungicides can help. Consult local extension services for specific recommendations.

Control Insects: Some insects can create entry points for the fungus. Manage insect pests.

Prevention:

Prune trees annually during dormancy to remove dead wood and cankers, and improve air circulation.

Remove mummified fruit from trees.

Clean up fallen fruit and debris.

Maintain tree vigor through proper fertilization and watering, but avoid excessive nitrogen.

Protect trees from injury (e.g., winter injury, lawnmower damage).

Use preventative fungicide sprays as needed.

Apple___Cedar_apple_rust

Disease: Cedar-Apple Rust (Gymnosporangium juniperi-virginianae)

Symptoms:

On Apple/Crabapple: Small, pale yellow spots appear on leaves shortly after bloom. Spots enlarge, becoming orange with small black dots (spermogonia) in the center. Later, tube-like structures (aecia) form on the underside of the leaf spots. Infected fruit may develop similar orange lesions. Severe infection can cause leaf drop.

On Cedar/Juniper (Alternate Host): Forms hard, brown, golf-ball-sized galls on twigs. In spring during wet weather, orange, gelatinous "horns" emerge from these galls, releasing spores that infect apple trees.

What the Farmer Should Do (Treatment):

Fungicides: Apply preventative fungicides to apple trees starting at bud break and continuing until about 30 days after petal fall. Effective fungicides include myclobutanil, fenarimol, or mancozeb. Timing is critical based on spore release from nearby cedars during wet spring weather.

Resistant Varieties: Choose apple or crabapple varieties that are resistant to cedar-apple rust.

Remove Galls (on Cedar): Prune out the brown galls from nearby cedar/juniper trees during late winter before the orange horns emerge. This is often impractical if cedars are numerous or not on your property.

Prevention:

Plant resistant apple/crabapple varieties.

Avoid planting susceptible apple/crabapple trees near susceptible cedar/juniper species (ideally separate them by several hundred yards to miles, though this is often difficult).

Apply preventative fungicides to apple trees during spring infection periods.

Remove cedar galls where feasible.

Cherry_(including_sour)___Powdery_mildew

Disease: Cherry Powdery Mildew (Podosphaera clandestina)

Symptoms:

White, powdery patches appearing on leaves, especially new growth and shoots.

Patches can enlarge and cover entire leaves, stems, and sometimes fruit.

Infected leaves may become distorted, curled, stunted, or drop prematurely.

Young infected fruit may develop rusty spots or patches and may be deformed.

What the Farmer Should Do (Treatment):

Fungicides: Apply fungicides specifically labeled for cherry powdery mildew. Start applications when conditions become favorable (warm temperatures, high humidity, often after petal fall) and continue according to the label. Effective fungicides include sulfur, potassium bicarbonate, oils (horticultural or neem), myclobutanil, and others. Rotate fungicide types to prevent resistance.

Pruning: Prune trees to improve air circulation within the canopy, which helps leaves dry faster and reduces humidity. Remove heavily infected shoots if practical.

Water Management: Avoid overhead irrigation that keeps foliage wet for long periods.

Prevention:

Choose planting sites with good air movement and full sun exposure.

Prune trees annually to maintain an open canopy.

Apply preventative fungicides starting shortly after bloom, especially if the disease was present the previous year or conditions are favorable.

Monitor trees closely, especially young shoots, for the first signs of mildew.

Corn_(maize)___Cercospora_leaf_spot Gray_leaf_spot

Disease: Gray Leaf Spot (GLS) of Corn (Cercospora zeae-maydis / Cercospora zeina)

Symptoms:

Initial symptoms are small, pinpoint lesions surrounded by yellow halos, often appearing on lower leaves first.

Lesions elongate into narrow, rectangular spots (1/4 to 2 inches long), pale brown or gray, restricted by leaf veins.

Spots may merge, blighting large areas of the leaf.

Under humid conditions, grayish fungal growth (spores) may be visible on the lesions.

Symptoms typically appear around tasseling time or shortly after.

What the Farmer Should Do (Treatment):

Fungicides: Foliar fungicides can be effective if applied preventatively or early in the disease development, especially on susceptible hybrids when conditions are favorable (warm, humid, prolonged leaf wetness) and disease is present. Timing is crucial, often around tasseling (VT) to early silking (R1). Consult local extension recommendations for thresholds and effective products (e.g., strobilurins, triazoles, or mixtures).

Scouting: Monitor fields regularly, especially lower leaves, starting before tasseling, to determine if and when fungicide application is warranted.

Prevention:

Resistant Hybrids: Planting corn hybrids with good genetic resistance to Gray Leaf Spot is the most effective management strategy.

Crop Rotation: Rotate corn with non-host crops (like soybeans or small grains) to reduce the amount of fungal inoculum surviving in residue.

Tillage: Burying infected corn residue through tillage can reduce inoculum levels, although this may conflict with conservation tillage practices.

Manage Irrigation: Avoid overhead irrigation during periods likely to extend leaf wetness duration if possible.

Corn_(maize)__Common_rust

Disease: Common Rust of Corn (Puccinia sorghi)

Symptoms:

Small, cinnamon-brown, powdery pustules (uredinia) scattered on both upper and lower leaf surfaces.

Pustules are oval or elongated.

As the pustules rupture, they release reddish-brown spores that can cover the leaf surface.

Late in the season, pustules may turn black (telia), but these are less common than the brown stage.

Often appears earlier in the season than Southern Rust.

What the Farmer Should Do (Treatment):

Fungicides: Fungicide applications are rarely necessary or economically beneficial for Common Rust management in field corn, as most modern hybrids have good resistance. If severe infection occurs on susceptible hybrids (especially sweet corn) early in development, fungicides used for other foliar diseases may provide some control.

Scouting: Monitor fields, but distinguish Common Rust from the more damaging Southern Rust (which typically has pustules mostly on the upper leaf surface and appears later in warmer conditions).

Prevention:

Resistant Hybrids: Planting hybrids with genetic resistance is the primary and most effective management method. Most field corn hybrids have adequate resistance. Sweet corn varieties vary in susceptibility.

Early Planting: Planting early may help the crop mature before rust levels become severe, although this is generally not a primary management tactic for Common Rust.

Corn_(maize)___Northern_Leaf_Blight

Disease: Northern Corn Leaf Blight (NCLB) (Exserohilum turcicum, syn. Helminthosporium turcicum)

Symptoms:

Large (1 to 6 inches long), elliptical or cigar-shaped lesions on leaves.

Lesions are typically grayish-green to tan.

Under humid conditions, dark, fuzzy fungal sporulation may be visible within the lesions.

Lesions often start on lower leaves and progress upwards.

Severe infections can cause extensive leaf blighting, resembling frost damage.

What the Farmer Should Do (Treatment):

Fungicides: Foliar fungicides can be effective, especially when applied preventatively or early in disease development on susceptible hybrids under favorable conditions (moderate temperatures, high humidity, frequent rainfall). Applications around tasseling (VT) are often most beneficial if disease pressure warrants it. Consult local recommendations for thresholds and products (strobilurins, triazoles, mixtures).

Scouting: Monitor fields regularly, especially susceptible hybrids, starting before tasseling. Assess disease severity and location within the canopy to determine the need for fungicides.

Prevention:

Resistant Hybrids: Planting corn hybrids with genetic resistance (both race-specific and partial resistance are available) is the most effective management strategy.

Crop Rotation: Rotate corn with non-host crops to reduce inoculum survival in residue.

Tillage: Burying infected residue through tillage reduces inoculum levels, but consider conservation implications.

Grape___Black_rot

Disease: Grape Black Rot (Guignardia bidwellii)

Symptoms:

Leaves: Small, circular, reddish-brown spots appear on leaves. Spots enlarge, developing dark borders and tiny black dots (pycnidia - fungal structures) within the tan center.

Shoots/Tendrils: Similar lesions can occur, appearing dark and elongated.

Fruit: Infection usually starts when berries are half-grown. A small whitish spot appears, quickly surrounded by a brown ring. The entire berry rots, turns dark brown/black, shrivels, and becomes covered in pycnidia, resembling a hard, black mummy.

What the Farmer Should Do (Treatment):

Sanitation: Remove and destroy infected fruit mummies from the vine and the ground during dormancy. Prune out infected canes or tendrils.

Fungicides: Apply preventative fungicides starting shortly before bloom and continuing through veraison (when berries begin to soften and color). Regular applications (e.g., every 7-14 days, depending on fungicide and weather) are crucial, especially during warm, wet periods. Effective fungicides include mancozeb, captan, ziram, and various DMI (e.g., myclobutanil) and QoI (strobilurin) fungicides. Rotate fungicide classes to prevent resistance.

Canopy Management: Pruning and leaf removal to improve air circulation and sunlight penetration helps foliage and fruit dry quickly, reducing infection periods.

Prevention:

Sanitation: Thoroughly clean up mummies and infected debris during winter.

Resistant Varieties: Some grape varieties are less susceptible than others, but most Vitis vinifera cultivars are susceptible.

Site Selection: Choose sites with good air drainage and sun exposure.

Canopy Management: Practice good pruning, training, and leaf removal techniques.

Fungicide Program: Implement a rigorous preventative fungicide spray schedule during critical infection periods (pre-bloom through veraison).

Grape___Esca_(Black_Measles)

Disease: Grape Esca (Black Measles) (Complex of fungi, primarily Phaeomoniella chlamydospora, Phaeoacremonium spp., Fomitiporia mediterranea)

Symptoms:

Chronic Form (Leaf Symptoms): Interveinal chlorosis (yellowing) or necrosis (browning) on leaves, often in a "tiger stripe" pattern. Leaves may eventually dry and drop.

Chronic Form (Fruit Symptoms - "Black Measles"): Small, dark spots ("measles") appear on berries, sometimes surrounded by a purplish halo. Berries may crack.

Apoplexy (Sudden Collapse): In hot weather, apparently healthy vines or parts of vines may suddenly wilt and die within a few days or weeks.

Wood Symptoms: Cross-section of infected trunk or cordons shows dark brown or black spots (necrosis) in the xylem, sometimes with pinkish or yellowish decayed wood in the center (caused by Fomitiporia).

What the Farmer Should Do (Treatment):

Surgery/Pruning: There is NO cure for Esca once the wood-decay fungi are established. Management focuses on preventing spread and managing symptoms. Prune out dead or dying arms/cordons, cutting back well below visible symptoms until clean, healthy wood is reached. Disinfect pruning tools frequently (e.g., with 10% bleach or Lysol). Remove and destroy pruned wood. Double pruning (making an initial long cut in winter, then a final shorter cut in late spring) may help visualize and remove infected wood.

Trunk Renewal: If infection is severe but the rootstock appears healthy, consider cutting the trunk back below symptoms and retraining a new trunk from a basal sucker.

Prevention:

Protect Pruning Wounds: Pruning creates entry points for Esca fungi. Prune later in the dormant season (during dry weather if possible). Apply a wound protectant (e.g., wound sealant or specific fungicides like thiophanate-methyl) immediately after making large cuts.

Sanitation: Remove and destroy infected vines or prunings. Disinfect tools.

Healthy Planting Material: Start with certified disease-free nursery stock.

Avoid Stress: Maintain vine health through proper irrigation and nutrition, as stress may exacerbate symptoms.

Training: Establish cordons slowly and avoid large wounds on young vines. Consider training systems that allow for easy trunk renewal.

Grape___Leaf_blight_(Isariopsis_Leaf_Spot)

Disease: Grape Leaf Blight / Isariopsis Leaf Spot (Pseudocercospora vitis)

Symptoms:

Irregularly shaped, reddish-brown spots appearing on leaves, usually later in the growing season (mid-summer to fall).

Spots enlarge and may merge, causing large blighted areas.

The center of the spots may become tan or grayish as the tissue dies.

Small, dark, bristly structures (fungal sporulation) may become visible within the lesions, especially on the underside of the leaf.

Severely infected leaves may yellow and drop prematurely, potentially weakening the vine for the following season.

Fruit infection is rare.

What the Farmer Should Do (Treatment):

Fungicides: Fungicides applied for other grape diseases (like Black Rot, Downy Mildew, Powdery Mildew) often provide adequate control of Isariopsis Leaf Spot. If specific treatment is needed late in the season, consult local recommendations. Mancozeb or copper-based fungicides may be effective.

Sanitation: Raking and destroying fallen leaves in autumn can help reduce the amount of overwintering fungus.

Prevention:

Canopy Management: Proper pruning, training, and leaf removal to improve air circulation and sunlight penetration helps leaves dry quickly, reducing fungal infection.

Sanitation: Clean up fallen leaves in the fall.

Fungicide Program: A standard fungicide program targeting major grape diseases usually manages Isariopsis Leaf Spot effectively.

Orange___Haunglongbing_(Citrus_greening)

Disease: Huanglongbing (HLB) / Citrus Greening (Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus, americanus, africanus - bacteria)

Symptoms:

Leaf Mottling: Asymmetrical yellowing of leaves, often blotchy or mottled, not confined by leaf veins (unlike nutrient deficiencies). One of the most characteristic symptoms.

Yellow Shoots: Shoots may flush yellow instead of green.

Fruit Issues: Small, lopsided fruit with a bitter taste. Fruit may remain green at the bottom (stylar end) even when ripe ("greening"). Seeds are often aborted and dark.

Twig Dieback: Progressive decline of the tree, twig dieback, sparse foliage.

Stunting: Overall stunting and reduced productivity.

What the Farmer Should Do (Treatment):

THERE IS NO CURE FOR HLB. Management focuses entirely on preventing spread and managing the insect vector.

Remove Infected Trees: Infected trees act as a source of bacteria for psyllids to spread. Prompt removal and destruction of infected trees is critical, especially in newly infested areas.

Control Asian Citrus Psyllid (ACP): This insect transmits the bacteria. Implement a rigorous psyllid control program using recommended insecticides. This often involves coordinated sprays within an area. Biological control options are also being explored.

Nutritional Support: Enhanced nutritional programs may help infected trees remain productive for longer, but do not cure the disease.

Prevention:

Control the Vector: Strict control of the Asian Citrus Psyllid (ACP) population through monitoring and timely insecticide applications is the primary prevention method.

Use Certified Nursery Stock: Plant only trees certified to be free of HLB bacteria, sourced from reputable nurseries.

Scouting and Removal: Regularly inspect trees for HLB symptoms. Remove and destroy infected trees immediately to prevent further spread.

Quarantines: Respect and adhere to area quarantines designed to prevent the movement of infected plant material or psyllids.

Biological Control: Support efforts to establish natural enemies of the ACP.

Peach___Bacterial_spot

Disease: Peach Bacterial Spot (Xanthomonas arboricola pv. pruni)

Symptoms:

Leaves: Small, water-soaked spots appear, turning purplish or brown. Centers of spots often fall out, leaving a "shot-hole" appearance. Severely infected leaves may turn yellow and drop. Angular lesions limited by veins are common.

Fruit: Small, circular, sunken spots develop on the fruit surface. Spots may crack or ooze bacteria in humid conditions. Lesions can make fruit unmarketable.

Twigs: Dark, sunken cankers ("spring cankers") may form on young twigs, sometimes causing tip dieback ("black tip").

What the Farmer Should Do (Treatment):

Copper Sprays: Apply fixed copper fungicides during the dormant season (late fall after leaf drop and/or early spring before bud swell) to reduce overwintering bacteria. Caution: Copper can cause phytotoxicity (leaf damage) if applied after leaves emerge, especially under cool, slow-drying conditions.

Antibiotics (Limited Use): Oxytetracycline (an antibiotic) may be applied during the growing season (from petal fall through cover sprays), especially during warm, wet periods. Resistance can be an issue, and timing/coverage are critical. Follow label instructions carefully.

Resistant Varieties: Choose varieties known to have better resistance or tolerance to bacterial spot. Resistance varies greatly.

Prevention:

Resistant Varieties: Planting less susceptible peach and nectarine varieties is the most effective long-term strategy.

Site Selection: Choose sites with good air circulation to promote rapid drying of foliage and fruit.

Dormant Copper Sprays: Apply copper sprays during dormancy.

Pruning: Prune to improve air circulation. Remove cankered twigs where feasible.

Nitrogen Management: Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, which promotes susceptible new growth.

Summer Antibiotic Sprays: Apply oxytetracycline preventatively during warm, wet weather in the growing season if disease pressure is high.

Pepper,_bell___Bacterial_spot

Disease: Bell Pepper Bacterial Spot (Xanthomonas campestris pv. vesicatoria and other Xanthomonas species)

Symptoms:

Leaves: Small, water-soaked spots appear first, often on lower leaves. Spots enlarge, become circular or irregular, and turn brown to black with tan centers. Spots may merge, causing blighting. Leaves may yellow and drop, especially under stress. Unlike peach, distinct "shot-holes" are less common.

Fruit: Small, raised, blister-like spots appear on green fruit. Spots enlarge, become brown, scabby, or cracked. These lesions reduce marketability and allow entry for secondary rot organisms.

Stems/Petioles: Elongated, dark lesions can occur.

What the Farmer Should Do (Treatment):

Copper Bactericides: Apply copper-based bactericides (e.g., copper hydroxide, copper sulfate) mixed with mancozeb preventatively. Start applications before disease appears or at the very first sign, especially if weather forecasts predict warm, wet conditions. Repeat applications every 7-10 days during favorable weather. Note: Copper resistance is common in some bacterial strains; effectiveness may be limited.

Plant Activators: Products containing acibenzolar-S-methyl (e.g., Actigard) can help induce the plant's natural defenses but must be applied preventatively before infection.

Sanitation: Remove heavily infected plants if disease incidence is low to reduce spread. Avoid working in fields when foliage is wet.

Prevention:

Resistant Varieties: Use pepper varieties with genetic resistance to bacterial spot races prevalent in your area. This is the most effective control method.

Clean Seed/Transplants: Use certified disease-free seed and transplants. Hot water treatment or chlorine treatment of seeds may help reduce bacterial load but can affect germination.

Crop Rotation: Rotate peppers with non-host crops for at least 1 year (preferably longer). Avoid rotating with tomatoes or other susceptible Solanaceae.

Sanitation: Remove and destroy crop debris after harvest. Control susceptible weeds. Avoid working with plants when they are wet. Thoroughly clean equipment between fields.

Water Management: Avoid overhead irrigation if possible, or water early in the day so foliage dries quickly. Improve soil drainage.

Preventative Sprays: Use copper+mancozeb sprays preventatively during favorable weather (warm, humid, rainy).

Potato___Early_blight

Disease: Potato Early Blight (Alternaria solani)

Symptoms:

Leaves: Dark brown to black spots appear, typically starting on lower, older leaves. Spots are often circular or irregular and develop characteristic concentric rings, resembling a "target" or "bull's-eye". A yellow halo may surround the spots. Lesions enlarge and merge, causing leaves to yellow, wither, and die.

Stems: Dark, slightly sunken lesions can occur, potentially girdling stems.

Tubers: Dark, slightly sunken, circular or irregular lesions appear on the tuber surface. The underlying tissue is typically dry, brown, and corky, usually not penetrating deeply (unlike Late Blight).

What the Farmer Should Do (Treatment):

Fungicides: Apply protective fungicides preventatively, especially when conditions are favorable (warm temperatures, high humidity, rainfall, dew) and plants are reaching maturity or under stress. Start applications before disease becomes severe. Many fungicides are effective, including those containing chlorothalonil, mancozeb, azoxystrobin, pyraclostrobin, and boscalid. Rotate fungicide classes to prevent resistance. Follow label instructions.

Harvest Timing: Harvest tubers promptly after vines die to reduce tuber infection risk. Avoid injury during harvest.

Prevention:

Resistant Varieties: Choose potato varieties with some tolerance or resistance to early blight.

Crop Rotation: Rotate potatoes with non-susceptible crops (not tomatoes or eggplants) for 2-3 years.

Sanitation: Remove or bury crop debris after harvest. Control susceptible weeds (e.g., nightshade).

Healthy Seed: Plant certified disease-free seed potatoes.

Proper Nutrition & Watering: Maintain adequate soil fertility (especially nitrogen) and consistent soil moisture to reduce plant stress, which makes them more susceptible. Avoid overhead irrigation late in the day.

Vine Killing: Kill vines completely 2-3 weeks before harvest to allow skins to set and reduce tuber infection during harvest.

Preventative Fungicides: Apply fungicides based on weather forecasts or disease prediction models (e.g., P-Days).

Potato___Late_blight

Disease: Potato Late Blight (Phytophthora infestans) - (Same pathogen as Tomato Late Blight)

Symptoms:

Leaves: Water-soaked, pale green to dark green/brown spots, often starting at leaf edges or tips. Lesions enlarge rapidly under cool, moist conditions. A fuzzy white ring of fungal growth (sporangia) may appear on the underside of leaves at the edge of lesions, especially in the morning when humidity is high. Leaves quickly blacken, wither, and die. A distinct odor may be present in heavily infected fields.

Stems: Dark brown to black lesions can girdle stems, causing collapse.

Tubers: Reddish-brown, granular decay appears under the skin, spreading irregularly inwards. The surface may be slightly sunken. Secondary bacterial infections can lead to soft rot.

What the Farmer Should Do (Treatment):

Fungicides: Late blight requires aggressive fungicide management. Apply fungicides preventatively based on disease forecasting models (e.g., Blitecast, Simcast) or when the disease is reported in the area. Start early and maintain regular spray intervals (e.g., 5-10 days depending on weather and product). Use fungicides specifically effective against oomycetes (like Phytophthora), including protectants (mancozeb, chlorothalonil) and systemic/translaminar products (cymoxanil, dimethomorph, fluopicolide, mandipropamid, etc.). Rotate fungicide modes of action. Ensure thorough coverage.

Destroy Infected Plants: If infection is limited, remove and destroy infected plants immediately (bag securely).

Vine Killing: Kill vines thoroughly at least 2 weeks before harvest to prevent spores from washing onto tubers.

Prevention:

Resistant Varieties: Plant potato varieties with genetic resistance to late blight. Resistance levels vary.

Clean Seed: Use certified disease-free seed potatoes. Avoid saving seed from infected crops.

Eliminate Sources: Destroy cull piles and volunteer potato/tomato plants, as these are major sources of initial infection.

Water Management: Avoid overhead irrigation, especially late in the day. Ensure good drainage.

Air Circulation: Space plants adequately.

Scouting: Monitor fields frequently, especially during cool, moist weather. Check low spots and edges first.

Preventative Fungicides: Follow a strict preventative fungicide program based on forecasting and local conditions.

Squash___Powdery_mildew

Disease: Squash Powdery Mildew (Several fungal species, e.g., Podosphaera xanthii, Erysiphe cichoracearum)

Symptoms:

White, powdery spots appearing on the upper and lower surfaces of leaves, petioles, and stems. Often starts on older, shaded leaves.

Spots enlarge and merge, potentially covering entire leaves.

Infected leaves may turn yellow, then brown and dry, eventually dying.

Severe infection reduces photosynthesis, potentially leading to smaller fruit, poor flavor, and sunscald on fruit due to leaf loss.

Fruit infection is less common but can occur.

What the Farmer Should Do (Treatment):

Fungicides: Apply fungicides at the first sign of disease, or preventatively if disease pressure is high. Many options exist, including:

Biologicals/Biorationals: Potassium bicarbonate, horticultural oils, neem oil, microbial fungicides (e.g., Bacillus subtilis). Often require frequent application and thorough coverage. Good for organic production.

Conventional Fungicides: Products containing sulfur, myclobutanil, tebuconazole, azoxystrobin, quinoxyfen, cyflufenamid, etc. Rotate modes of action to prevent resistance. Follow label instructions carefully, especially regarding pre-harvest intervals.

Remove Infected Leaves: If disease is caught early and incidence is low, removing the lowest, most heavily infected leaves might help slow spread, but this is often impractical.

Prevention:

Resistant Varieties: Plant squash, pumpkin, and melon varieties with genetic resistance or tolerance to powdery mildew. This is the most effective strategy. Check seed catalogs for resistance ratings.

Good Air Circulation: Space plants adequately. Prune some older or overlapping leaves if the canopy is extremely dense (use caution not to remove too many). Trellising vining types can help.

Sunlight: Plant in full sun. Powdery mildew often starts in shaded areas.

Avoid Excess Nitrogen: Lush, rapid growth can be more susceptible.

Water Management: Water at the base of plants. Avoid overhead irrigation that wets leaves, especially late in the day.

Preventative Sprays: In areas with high disease pressure, preventative fungicide applications (especially biologicals or oils) may be started before symptoms appear.

Strawberry___Leaf_scorch

Disease: Strawberry Leaf Scorch (Diplocarpon earlianum)

Symptoms:

Small, irregular, purplish spots appear on the upper surface of leaves.

Spots enlarge and merge, forming larger reddish-purple to brown blotches.

Unlike leaf spot, scorch lesions do not typically develop distinct light-colored centers.

Tiny black dots (acervuli - fungal structures) may appear within the lesions.

In severe cases, leaves may dry up, curl, and appear "scorched".

Lesions can also occur on petioles, runners, and fruit caps (calyxes).

What the Farmer Should Do (Treatment):

Fungicides: Fungicides applied for other common strawberry foliar diseases (like leaf spot, anthracnose) often provide control for leaf scorch. Applications should begin early in the spring and continue as needed, especially during periods of wet weather. Effective fungicides include captan, pyraclostrobin, azoxystrobin, and others. Rotate chemistries.

Sanitation: Remove heavily infected older leaves during renovation (after harvest) for matted row systems, or periodically in plasticulture systems, to reduce inoculum.

Prevention:

Resistant Varieties: Choose strawberry varieties known to be resistant or tolerant to leaf scorch. Resistance levels vary.

Site Selection & Air Circulation: Plant in sites with full sun and good air movement. Avoid overcrowding plants. Use raised beds if drainage is poor.

Water Management: Water early in the day so foliage can dry quickly. Use drip irrigation instead of overhead sprinklers if possible.

Sanitation: Remove dead leaves and plant debris after harvest and during the dormant season.

Nitrogen Management: Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, which can promote dense, susceptible foliage.

Preventative Fungicides: Apply fungicides preventatively, starting early in the season, based on variety susceptibility and weather conditions.

Tomato___Bacterial_spot

Disease: Tomato Bacterial Spot (Xanthomonas species - X. vesicatoria, X. euvesicatoria, X. perforans, X. gardneri)

Symptoms:

Leaves: Small (less than 1/8 inch), water-soaked, circular spots appear first. Spots enlarge, become angular or irregular, dark brown to black, and may have a greasy appearance. A yellow halo may or may not be present depending on the bacterial species and conditions. Spots can merge, leading to blighting. Unlike Septoria leaf spot, bacterial spot lesions usually do not have tiny black dots (pycnidia) in the center. Severely affected leaves often yellow and drop.

Fruit: Small, water-soaked spots appear on green fruit. Spots enlarge, become slightly raised, brown to black, and develop a rough, scabby texture. Lesions are usually superficial but reduce marketability and allow entry for secondary rots.

Stems/Petioles: Elongated dark lesions can occur.

What the Farmer Should Do (Treatment):

Copper Bactericides: Apply copper-based bactericides (e.g., copper hydroxide) mixed with mancozeb preventatively. Start before disease appears, especially if warm, wet weather is forecast. Reapply every 7-10 days during favorable conditions. Copper resistance is widespread, so efficacy may be limited. Mancozeb helps manage copper resistance and provides some fungal control.

Plant Activators: Products containing acibenzolar-S-methyl (e.g., Actigard) can help induce the plant's natural defenses but must be applied preventatively before infection.

Bacteriophages: Some biological products containing bacteriophages (viruses that attack bacteria) are available but require specific application strategies.

Sanitation: Avoid working with plants when they are wet to prevent spreading bacteria. Remove heavily infected plants early if feasible.

Prevention:

Resistant Varieties: Planting resistant or tolerant tomato varieties is the most effective management strategy. Check variety descriptions for resistance claims against Xanthomonas races.

Clean Seed/Transplants: Use certified disease-free seed and transplants. Hot water or chlorine seed treatments can reduce bacteria but may impact germination. Inspect transplants carefully.

Crop Rotation: Rotate tomatoes with non-Solanaceous crops (not peppers, potatoes, eggplants) for at least 2-3 years.

Sanitation: Remove and destroy crop debris promptly after harvest. Control susceptible weeds (e.g., nightshade). Disinfect stakes, tools, and equipment. Avoid working when plants are wet.

Water Management: Use drip irrigation instead of overhead sprinklers. If overhead must be used, water early so foliage dries quickly. Ensure good soil drainage.

Preventative Sprays: Apply copper+mancozeb or plant activators preventatively, especially during warm (75-86°F / 24-30°C), humid, and rainy periods.

Tomato___Early_blight

Disease: Tomato Early Blight (Alternaria linariae, formerly Alternaria solani) - (Same pathogen group as Potato Early Blight)

Symptoms:

Leaves: Dark brown to black spots, often starting on lower, older leaves. Spots enlarge (up to 1/2 inch) and develop characteristic concentric rings like a "target" or "bull's-eye". A yellow halo typically surrounds the spots. Lesions merge, causing leaves to yellow, wither, dry up, and drop (defoliation), often progressing from the bottom of the plant upwards.

Stems: Dark, slightly sunken lesions ("collar rot") can occur near the soil line on seedlings or transplants, potentially girdling the stem. Lesions can also appear higher on stems and petioles.

Fruit: Dark, sunken lesions can develop on the fruit, usually near the stem end (calyx). These lesions also often show concentric rings and can become quite large, sometimes covered with black fungal growth.

What the Farmer Should Do (Treatment):

Fungicides: Apply fungicides preventatively or at the very first sign of disease. Start applications when plants begin to set fruit or earlier if disease appears. Reapply every 7-14 days depending on weather conditions (warm, humid, rainfall) and product label. Effective fungicides include chlorothalonil, mancozeb, copper-based products, azoxystrobin, pyraclostrobin, boscalid, and others. Rotate fungicide classes to prevent resistance.

Sanitation: Remove and destroy infected lower leaves if disease is caught early and incidence is low (this may not be practical on a large scale).

Prevention:

Resistant Varieties: Choose tomato varieties with tolerance or resistance to early blight.

Crop Rotation: Rotate tomatoes with non-Solanaceous crops (not potatoes, peppers, eggplants) for 2-3 years.

Sanitation: Remove or bury crop debris after harvest. Control susceptible weeds like nightshade and horsenettle. Use stakes or cages to keep plants off the ground. Disinfect stakes.

Healthy Transplants: Use certified disease-free transplants. Inspect carefully.

Proper Nutrition & Watering: Maintain balanced fertility (avoid excess nitrogen). Keep soil consistently moist but not waterlogged. Mulch to prevent soil splash. Water at the base of the plant early in the day.

Air Circulation: Space plants adequately. Stake or cage plants. Prune lower leaves (suckers) as appropriate for the variety type (determinate vs. indeterminate) to improve airflow.

Preventative Fungicides: Apply fungicides based on weather forecasts and scouting.

Tomato___Late_blight

Disease: Tomato Late Blight (Phytophthora infestans) - (Same pathogen as Potato Late Blight)

Symptoms:

Leaves: Large, water-soaked, pale green to dark brown/black spots (lesions), often starting on upper leaves or stems. Lesions expand very rapidly in cool, moist conditions. A fuzzy white ring of fungal growth (sporangia) may appear on the underside of leaves at the edge of active lesions, especially in the morning or during high humidity. Infected leaves quickly wither, blacken, and die. A characteristic musty odor can be present.

Stems: Large, dark brown to black lesions can develop, potentially girdling and killing stems above the lesion.

Fruit: Greasy-looking, firm, brown, rough-textured blotches appear on green or ripening fruit, often starting near the stem end. These lesions enlarge rapidly and can cover much of the fruit surface. Secondary soft rots often follow.

What the Farmer Should Do (Treatment):

Fungicides: Late blight requires immediate and aggressive fungicide management. Apply fungicides preventatively if the disease is forecast or reported nearby, OR at the very first sign of infection. Maintain very tight spray intervals (e.g., 5-7 days) during favorable cool, wet weather. Use fungicides specifically effective against oomycetes (Phytophthora), including protectants (mancozeb, chlorothalonil) and systemic/translaminar products (cymoxanil, dimethomorph, fluopicolide, mandipropamid, mefenoxam, etc.). Rotate fungicide modes of action rigorously to prevent resistance. Ensure thorough plant coverage.

Destroy Infected Plants: If infection is found early and is limited, immediately remove and destroy infected plants (bag securely or burn). Do not compost. This is critical to slow spread. In severe outbreaks, destroying the entire planting may be necessary.

Prevention:

Resistant Varieties: Plant tomato varieties with genetic resistance to late blight. Check variety descriptions carefully as resistance can be race-specific and may not hold up against all strains.

Clean Transplants/Seed: Use certified disease-free transplants. While less common, the pathogen can sometimes be seedborne.

Eliminate Sources: Destroy volunteer tomato and potato plants and cull piles, as these are major overwintering/early season sources. Be aware of nearby potato fields.

Air Circulation & Leaf Dryness: Space plants widely. Use stakes or cages. Prune lower leaves. Ensure good greenhouse ventilation. Avoid overhead irrigation, especially late in the day. Water early. Use mulch.

Scouting: Monitor plants frequently (daily or every other day during favorable weather), especially after cool, wet periods. Check upper leaves first. Be aware of local disease reports.

Preventative Fungicides: Follow a strict preventative fungicide program based on forecasting models (like Blitecast or USAblight.org) and local conditions. Start sprays before disease is seen if forecasts are high-risk.

Tomato___Leaf_Mold

Disease: Tomato Leaf Mold (Passalora fulva, formerly Fulvia fulva or Cladosporium fulvum)

Symptoms:

Primarily a disease in greenhouses or high tunnels due to high humidity requirements. Less common in open fields.

Pale greenish-yellow spots, often indistinct, appear on the upper surface of leaves, usually starting on older leaves.

Corresponding areas on the underside of the leaf develop patches of dense, olive-green to brownish, velvety/fuzzy mold (fungal spores). This is the key diagnostic feature.

Spots enlarge and merge. Affected leaves turn yellow, then brown, wither, and may drop prematurely.

Flowers and fruit can occasionally be infected, resulting in black, leathery rot at the stem end of the fruit.

What the Farmer Should Do (Treatment):

Environmental Control (Crucial in Greenhouses): Reduce humidity and improve air circulation.

Ventilate greenhouses/tunnels thoroughly, especially morning and evening, to exhaust moist air.

Use horizontal airflow fans (HAF).

Increase plant spacing.

Prune lower leaves and suckers to improve airflow within the canopy.

Avoid overhead watering; use drip irrigation. Water early in the day.

Heat the greenhouse slightly while ventilating in the morning to dry foliage faster.

Fungicides: Apply fungicides preventatively if conditions are highly favorable or at the first sign of disease. Options include chlorothalonil, mancozeb, copper-based products, and specific systemic fungicides. Check labels for greenhouse use. Thorough coverage, especially on leaf undersides, is important.

Sanitation: Remove and destroy heavily infected leaves or plants.

Prevention:

Resistant Varieties: Plant tomato varieties with genetic resistance to leaf mold. Many resistant greenhouse varieties are available (check for resistance codes like Ff). Note that new fungal races can overcome resistance.

Environmental Management: Prioritize humidity control (<85% RH) and air circulation in protected culture environments.

Sanitation: Remove crop debris thoroughly after the season. Disinfect greenhouse structures.

Water Management: Use drip irrigation. Avoid wetting foliage.

Preventative Fungicides: Consider preventative sprays if using susceptible varieties in a high-humidity environment.

Tomato___Septoria_leaf_spot

Disease: Tomato Septoria Leaf Spot (Septoria lycopersici)

Symptoms:

Numerous small (1/16 to 1/8 inch), circular spots appear, typically starting on the oldest, lowest leaves.

Spots have dark brown margins and lighter tan or grayish centers.

A key diagnostic feature is the presence of tiny, black dots (pycnidia - fungal fruiting bodies) visible within the center of the spots, often resembling sprinkled pepper.

Spots do not typically enlarge significantly but become very numerous.

Heavily infected leaves turn yellow, then brown, wither, and drop off, leading to significant defoliation from the bottom of the plant upwards.

Defoliation can expose fruit to sunscald.

What the Farmer Should Do (Treatment):

Fungicides: Apply fungicides preventatively or at the first sign of disease. Start applications when plants begin flowering and setting fruit, or earlier if disease appears. Reapply every 7-14 days depending on weather (warm, wet conditions favor spread) and product label. Effective fungicides include chlorothalonil, mancozeb, copper-based products, and some strobilurins (like azoxystrobin) or other systemic options. Rotate fungicide classes. Thorough coverage is important.

Sanitation: Remove and destroy infected lower leaves if disease is caught very early and incidence is low. This is often not practical but can help slow initial spread. Avoid working with plants when wet.

Prevention:

Crop Rotation: Rotate tomatoes with non-Solanaceous crops for 3-4 years, as the fungus survives on debris and related weeds.

Sanitation: Remove or deeply bury tomato debris after harvest. Control susceptible weeds (e.g., nightshade, horsenettle, jimsonweed). Disinfect stakes and cages.

Clean Seed/Transplants: Use certified disease-free seed and transplants if possible, though seed transmission is less critical than debris.

Improve Air Circulation: Space plants adequately. Stake or cage plants. Prune lower leaves as appropriate.

Water Management: Avoid overhead irrigation. Use drip irrigation or water at the base early in the day. Use mulch (plastic or organic) to create a barrier between soil and lower leaves.

Preventative Fungicides: Begin fungicide applications early, especially during periods of warm (68-77°F / 20-25°C), wet weather.

Tomato___Spider_mites Two-spotted_spider_mite

Pest: Two-Spotted Spider Mite (Tetranychus urticae) - Note: This is an arthropod pest, not a disease.

Symptoms:

Leaf Stippling: Initial damage appears as tiny yellow or whitish dots (stippling) on the upper leaf surface, caused by mites feeding on individual plant cells on the underside.

Yellowing/Bronzing: As mite populations increase, stippling merges, causing leaves to turn yellow, gray, or bronze.

Webbing: Fine webbing may become visible on the underside of leaves, between leaves, and on stems, especially in heavy infestations. Mites use this for protection and movement.

Leaf Drop: Severely infested leaves dry out, become brittle, and eventually drop.

Reduced Vigor/Yield: Heavy infestations stress the plant, reducing photosynthesis, growth, and fruit production.

What the Farmer Should Do (Treatment):

Water Spray: A strong spray of water, especially on the underside of leaves, can physically dislodge many mites. Do this early in the day so leaves dry. Repeat frequently.

Insecticidal Soaps/Horticultural Oils: Thoroughly spray infested plants, focusing on the underside of leaves. These products kill mites on contact but have no residual effect, so repeat applications (every 5-7 days) are necessary. Apply when temperatures are moderate to avoid leaf burn.

Miticides (Acaricides): If infestations are severe, specific miticides may be needed. Options include products containing spiromesifen, abamectin, etoxazole, bifenazate, or others. Rotate different modes of action to prevent resistance, which develops quickly in spider mites. Check labels for suitability on tomatoes and pre-harvest intervals. Some are harsh on beneficial insects.

Biological Control: Introduce predatory mites (e.g., Phytoseiulus persimilis, Neoseiulus californicus, Amblyseius fallacis) before spider mite populations become large. This is most effective in greenhouses or high tunnels but can work outdoors. Avoid broad-spectrum pesticides if using biologicals.

Prevention:

Scouting: Regularly inspect the underside of lower leaves for stippling, mites (use a hand lens - they are tiny), and webbing, especially during hot, dry weather. Early detection is key.

Reduce Dust: Dusty conditions favor spider mites. Keep dust down on nearby paths or roads.

Water Adequately: Drought-stressed plants are more susceptible. Keep plants well-watered.

Avoid Over-fertilizing: Excessive nitrogen can sometimes lead to softer growth that favors mites.

Conserve Beneficial Insects: Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that kill natural predators of spider mites (like predatory mites, lady beetles, lacewings).

Sanitation: Remove heavily infested plants or leaves if practical. Control weeds around the planting area, as mites can overwinter or build up on them.

Tomato___Target_Spot

Disease: Tomato Target Spot (Corynespora cassiicola)

Symptoms:

Leaves: Small, water-soaked spots appear first, often on older leaves. Spots enlarge into circular to irregular lesions (up to 1/2 inch) with distinct concentric rings (like a target), similar to Early Blight but often smaller and more numerous. Lesions are typically dark brown to black, sometimes with lighter centers. A yellow halo may be present. Severe infection leads to yellowing, blighting, and defoliation, progressing up the plant.

Fruit: Small, dark, sunken spots appear on ripening fruit. Lesions enlarge, become deeply sunken, and may develop a velvety black center (fungal sporulation). The appearance differs from the larger, zoned lesions of Early Blight on fruit.

Stems/Petioles: Elongated, dark lesions can occur.

What the Farmer Should Do (Treatment):

Fungicides: Apply fungicides preventatively or at the first sign of disease, especially during warm, humid, and rainy periods. Fungicides used for Early Blight and Septoria Leaf Spot often provide control for Target Spot. Effective options include chlorothalonil, mancozeb, copper-based products, and strobilurins (e.g., azoxystrobin). Rotate fungicide classes to manage resistance.

Sanitation: Remove crop debris after harvest. Avoid working with plants when they are wet.

Prevention:

Resistant Varieties: Some level of tolerance exists in certain tomato varieties, but high resistance is not common.

Crop Rotation: Rotate tomatoes with non-host crops for at least 2-3 years. The fungus has a wide host range, so rotation may be only partially effective.

Sanitation: Remove or bury plant debris promptly after harvest. Control weeds. Disinfect stakes and equipment.

Improve Air Circulation: Space plants adequately. Stake or cage plants. Prune lower leaves.

Water Management: Use drip irrigation or water at the base early in the day. Avoid prolonged leaf wetness. Mulch to reduce soil splash.

Preventative Fungicides: Start fungicide applications early in areas where Target Spot is common, especially if warm (70-80°F / 21-27°C) and humid/wet conditions prevail.

Tomato___Tomato_Yellow_Leaf_Curl_Virus

Disease: Tomato Yellow Leaf Curl Virus (TYLCV) (A group of related Begomoviruses)

Symptoms:

Severe Stunting: Plants infected early are severely stunted and bushy.

Leaf Curling: Leaves cup strongly upward or downward, become thickened, leathery, and smaller than normal.

Yellowing: Leaf margins often turn yellow (chlorosis), sometimes spreading between veins. Veins may appear purplish on the underside.

Flower Drop: Infected plants produce few flowers, and many that are produced drop off, leading to drastically reduced fruit set and yield.

Fruit: Fruit that does set may appear normal but are greatly reduced in number and sometimes size.

What the Farmer Should Do (Treatment):

THERE IS NO CURE FOR VIRUSES. Management focuses on preventing infection by controlling the insect vector (whiteflies) and removing infected plants.

Vector Control: Implement a strict management program for the whitefly vector (primarily Bemisia tabaci). This includes:

Insecticides: Use insecticides effective against whiteflies. Systemic insecticides applied at planting or early on can be helpful. Rotate insecticide modes of action frequently to combat resistance. Neonicotinoids, insect growth regulators (IGRs), oils, and soaps can be part of a program.

Monitoring: Use yellow sticky traps to monitor whitefly populations.

Physical Barriers: Use insect netting or row covers early in the season, especially in protected culture.

Remove Infected Plants: Identify and immediately remove (rogue) plants showing TYLCV symptoms. Bag them carefully to avoid disturbing whiteflies and destroy them far from the field.

Prevention:

Resistant Varieties: Plant tomato varieties with genetic resistance or tolerance to TYLCV. This is the most effective management strategy. Check variety descriptions for TYLCV resistance claims (e.g., Ty genes).

Vector Control: Start whitefly control measures early, before populations build up.

Clean Transplants: Use certified virus-free transplants sourced from reputable growers. Inspect transplants carefully.

Sanitation: Control weeds in and around the field, as many weeds can host whiteflies and sometimes the virus. Remove and destroy old crop debris promptly after harvest.

Reflective Mulches: Silver or reflective plastic mulches can help repel whiteflies early in the season.

Planting Time: In some regions, adjusting planting dates to avoid peak whitefly populations may help.

Host-Free Period: Maintain a period where no susceptible host plants (tomatoes, peppers, beans, certain weeds) are present to break the whitefly/virus cycle.

Tomato___Tomato_mosaic_virus

Disease: Tomato Mosaic Virus (ToMV) (Tobamovirus group) - (Closely related to Tobacco Mosaic Virus - TMV)

Symptoms:

Leaf Mosaic: Light green and dark green mottling or mosaic patterns on leaves.

Leaf Distortion: Leaves may be stunted, curled, or deformed (e.g., "fern leaf" symptom where leaf blades are narrow).

Stunting: Overall plant growth may be stunted.

Fruit Symptoms: Fruit yield is often reduced. Fruit may show uneven ripening, yellow blotches, or necrotic (brown) ringspots. Internal browning can occur. Symptom severity depends on the virus strain, tomato variety, and environmental conditions (especially temperature).

What the Farmer Should Do (Treatment):

THERE IS NO CURE FOR VIRUSES. Management focuses entirely on prevention and sanitation.

Remove Infected Plants: Identify and immediately remove plants showing clear mosaic symptoms. Handle them carefully to avoid touching healthy plants. Destroy removed plants. Wash hands thoroughly afterward.

Prevention:

Resistant Varieties: Plant tomato varieties with genetic resistance to ToMV/TMV. This is the most effective control method. Look for resistance codes like "Tm" in variety descriptions.

Clean Seed: Use certified virus-free seed or seed from reputable sources. The virus is highly seedborne. Hot water or acid treatments can reduce virus on seed coats but may affect germination.

Sanitation (CRITICAL):

Wash Hands: Wash hands thoroughly with soap and water BEFORE and DURING work with tomato plants (especially after handling tobacco products, as TMV is common in them).

Disinfect Tools: Regularly disinfect tools (pruners, stakes, ties) with a 10% bleach solution, trisodium phosphate (TSP), or other effective disinfectant.

Avoid Tobacco Use: Workers should not smoke or use tobacco products while handling tomato plants.

Control Weeds: Remove susceptible weed hosts from around the growing area.

Crop Debris: Remove and destroy plant debris after harvest.

Crop Rotation: While less effective due to the virus's persistence, rotation can help reduce inoculum.

Milk Spray (Limited Evidence): Some growers spray plants with milk solutions, believing it may inactivate the virus, but scientific evidence for effectiveness in the field is limited. Sanitation is far more important.
